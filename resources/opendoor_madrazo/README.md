# opendoor_madrazo
an interior and door fix for the la fuerte blance interior for fivem servers  
i left this fairly vanilla so server devs can alter it to work with esx if they choose  
( as most of the structure is a cobble of that code anyways.)  
  
USAGE::  
edit the steam id's of people you want to trust into the list.
( or replace that code with esx job roles )  
start opendoor_madrazo in your server.cfg  
  
Shouts to AusDOJ. the FiveM server this was made for!
