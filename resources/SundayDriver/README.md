# Sunday Driver

This is a mod for FiveM / GTA V that aims to make driving much more pleasant, especially if you want a realistic driving style.

## Features:
### Smooth Driving
* Smooth acceleration by manipulating engine torque relative to throttle position. (No effect for keyboards)
* Smooth braking by manipulating brake force relative to brake pedal position / trigger position. (No effect for keyboards)
* Remapped throttle response curve makes it much easier to maintain a steady speed, especially at lower speeds, like driving in the city at speed limits.
* Brake holder feature prevents vehicle from switching direction after braking.
* When at a standstill and keeping the brake depressed, the brake lights are on. Turns off as soon as you let go of the brake pedal.

## Configuration

Each option is explained in the file.

## Installation on FiveM Server

If you run a FiveM server, you know what to do... but these are the basic instructions, in case you forgot:

* Copy the .lua files to a new folder in your Resources folder
* Add a line to your config: start [foldername]
* Restart server or
* Refresh + start [foldername]

Where [foldername] is the folder in Resources where the two .lua files are located.
